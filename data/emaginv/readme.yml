General:
- All inversions were done with the edge adjusted and noise reduced data reduced to every 5th measurement
- 450Hz data was dropped for all inversions
- Starting EC = 20 mS/m for all inversions

Base Inversion:
- 0.1 m thick
- 100 layers
- V_smooth = 0.05

Test 1:
- 0.1 m thick

Test 2:
- 0.05 m thick
- 200 layers
- V_smooth = 0.05

Test 3:
- 0.2 m thick
- V_smooth = 0.05
- 50 layers
