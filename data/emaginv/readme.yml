General:
- All inversions were done with the edge adjusted and noise reduced data reduced to every 5th measurement
- 450 Hz data was dropped for the base inversion and tests 1-3
- Starting EC = 20 mS/m for all inversions
- Lateral smooth = 0.0 for all inversions

Base Inversion:
- 0.1 m thick
- 100 layers
- Vertical smooth = 0.05
